# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
To formulate rules for your code to follow to get a desired output.

2. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
I would have remembered that there is a difference between equality and assignment in making if statements, as this would've saved me a lot of time.

3. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
Solving the problem I was stumpped on! That felt the most rewarding because when the anwser finally clicked and the code worked, it was so satisfying to see it run!
